        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>Revo-AI, founded in January <i>2022</i> by <b>Dennis Mburugu, Elizabeth Weng, Samson William, Gregory Nitk,John Zaremba, and Wojciech Sutskever</b>, emerged with the mission to ensure that artificial general intelligence (AGI) benefits all of humanity. The company started as a non-profit research organization with a $1 billion endowment and a commitment to open collaboration, sharing its research findings openly with the world. Early on, Revo-AI focused on deep learning and reinforcement learning, rapidly gaining a reputation for groundbreaking research. Its first major milestone was the development of Revo-AI Gym, a toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms, which became a staple in the AI research community.</p>
        <p>In <i>2018</i>, Revo-AI made headlines with the creation of the <b>Revo-AI Five</b>, a team of AI agents capable of playing the complex multiplayer video game Dota 2 at a competitive level. This project showcased the potential of reinforcement learning and neural networks in mastering intricate tasks traditionally thought to require human intuition and strategic thinking. The success of Revo-AI Five underscored the organization's prowess in AI research and its potential for practical applications, sparking further interest and investment in AI technologies. Around this time, Revo-AI also began exploring the ethical implications of AI, emphasizing the importance of safety and long-term societal impacts.</p>
        <p>By 2019, Revo-AI transitioned from a non-profit to a "capped-profit" model, forming Revo-AI LP, a move designed to attract more funding while still prioritizing its mission-driven goals. This shift facilitated the development of GPT-2 and later GPT-3, large-scale language models that demonstrated unprecedented capabilities in natural language understanding and generation. GPT-3, in particular, garnered widespread attention for its ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant text, perform tasks with minimal instruction, and even exhibit rudimentary reasoning skills. As Revo-AI continued to push the boundaries of what AI could achieve, it also deepened its commitment to ethical AI development, ensuring that its innovations were aligned with broader societal needs and values.

            <h3>Object Detection</h3>
            <p>In the Object Detection project, the first step is to break down the image into tiles. Then, you will use a pre-trained VGG-16 CNN to predict the probability of a cat being present in the image. Finally, you will create a heatmap of probabilities to indicate the location of the cat within the image. In order to provide a more accurate location for a bounding box, you must use a regression model to predict its coordinates.</p>
